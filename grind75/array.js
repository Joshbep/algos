//an array is a data strcuture for storing more than one data item.
//memory locations are called elements
//totla number of elements in an array is called length

// An array is a container of elements.
// Elements have a specific value and data type, like “ABC”, TRUE or FALSE, etc.
// Each element also has its own index, which is used to access the element.

// Elements are stored at contiguous memory locations.
// An index is always less than the total number of array items.
// In terms of syntax, any variable that is declared as an array can store multiple values.
// Almost all languages have the same comprehension of arrays but have different ways of declaring and initializing them.
// However, three parts will always remain common in all the initializations, i.e., array name, elements, and the data type of elements.

//an array is a data strcuture for storing more than one data item.
//memory locations are called elements
//totla number of elements in an array is called length

// An array is a container of elements.
// Elements have a specific value and data type, like “ABC”, TRUE or FALSE, etc.
// Each element also has its own index, which is used to access the element.

// Elements are stored at contiguous memory locations.
// An index is always less than the total number of array items.
// In terms of syntax, any variable that is declared as an array can store multiple values.
// Almost all languages have the same comprehension of arrays but have different ways of declaring and initializing them.
// However, three parts will always remain common in all the initializations, i.e., array name, elements, and the data type of elements.

// Why do we need arrays?
// Here, are some reasons for using arrays in data structure:
//
// Arrays are best for storing multiple values in a single variable
// Arrays are better at processing many values easily and quickly
// Sorting and searching the values is easier in arrays

//times for common operations
//         ADD    Remove
//beg      O(n)    O(n)
//end      O(1)    O(1)
//middle   O(n)    O(n)

//time complexity
//access O(1)
//search O(n)
//search (sorted array) O(log(n))

//insert O(n)
//Insertion would require shifting all the subsequent elements to the right by one and that takes O(n)

//Insert (at the end) O(1)
//Special case of insertion where no other element needs to be shifted

//Remove 	O(n)
//Removal would require shifting all the subsequent elements to the left by one and that takes O(n)

//Remove (at the end) O(1) Special case of removal where no other element needs to be shifted

//greedy algos are an algorithm that solves the
//problem pretty well. And that’s where greedy algorithms shine, because
//they’re simple to write and usually get pretty close.

//8.1
//Answer: A greedy strategy would be to pick the largest box that
//will fit in the remaining space, and repeat until you can’t pack any
//more boxes. No, this won’t give you the optimal solution.
//8.2
//Answer: Keep picking the activity with the highest point value that
//you can still do in the time you have left. Stop when you can’t do
//anything else. No, this won’t give you the optimal solution.

//STACKS
//objectives

//define what a stack is
//understand use cases for a stack
//implement operations on a stack data structure

//what is a stack?

// A LIFO data strcuture

//the last element added to the stack will be the first element
//removed from the STACK

//think about a stack of plates, or a stack of markers, or stack of anything
//as you pile it up the last thing(or the topmost thing) is what gets removed first

//weve seen this before
//the call stack

//where stacks are used

//managing function invocations
//Undo/Redo
//routing (the history object) is treated like a stack!

//there is more than one way of implementing a stack

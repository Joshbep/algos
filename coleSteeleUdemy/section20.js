//Start of Doubly Linked Lists

//Objectives
//contruct a doubly linked list
//compare and contrast doubly and singly linked lists
//implement basic operations on a dobuly linked list

//almost identical to singly linked lists, except every node has another pointer, to the previous node

//you can not remove tail in singly linked list
//you can remove tail in doubly linked lists because a doubly linked list goes both ways

//code may be more complicated, bc we are keeping up with two pointers
//it takes up more memory

//comparisons with singly linked lists
//more memory === more flexibility
//it's almost always a tradeoff

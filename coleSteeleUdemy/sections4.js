//algos and problems solving patterns

//what is an algorithm?
//a process or a set of steps to accomplish a certain task

//HOW DO YOU IMPROVE
//1. Devise a plan for solving problems
//2. Master common problem solving patterns

//A simple, foolproof, magical, miraculous, fail-safe approach
//* NOT REALLY

//Problem SOLVING
//Understand the problem
//explore concrete examples
//break it down
//solve/simplify
//look back and refactor

//UNDERSTANDING PROBLEMS
//can you restate the problem in my own words?
//what are the inputs that go into the problem?
//what are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem
//can the outputs be determined from the inputs? in other words
//do I have enough information to solve the problem?(you may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That'sns okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage

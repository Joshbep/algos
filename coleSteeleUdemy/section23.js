//tree traversal

//traverse a tree
//TWO WAYS:
//BFS(Breadth-first Search)
//DFS(Depth-first Search)

//BFS

//DFS - in order

//BFS
//visit every node on the same level before moving to child

//BFS
//steps

//Create a queue(this cna be an array) and a  variable to store the values of nodes visited
//Place the root node in the queue
//loop as long as there is anything in the queue
  //dequeue a node

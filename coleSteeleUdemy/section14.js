//Big O of sorting algos
          //best    //average   //worst   /space
//bubble    O(n)     O(n^2)      O(n^2)     O(1)
//insertion O(n)     O(n^2)      O(n^2)     O(1)
//selection O(n^2)   O(n^2)      O(n^2)     O(1)

//sorting is fundamental!
//bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort are all roughly equivalent
//all have average time complexities that are quadratic
//we can do better... but we need more complex algos

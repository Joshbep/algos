//Binary search trees

//objectives
//define what a tree is

//compare and contrast trees and lists

//explain the differences between trees, binary trees, and binary search trees

//implement operations on BST (binary search trees)

//WHAT IS A TREE

//a data structure that consists of nodes ina  parent/child relationship


//lists - linear

//tree - nonlinear

//a singly linked list
//(sort of special case of a tree)

//a node can only point to a child

// can only have one root

//TREE TERMINOLOGY

//ROOT - The top node in a tree
//CHILD - A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root
//PARENT -  The converse notion of a child
// SINLINGS - a group of nodes with the same parent
//LEAF - a node with no children
//EDGE - the connection between one node and another


//TREES

//lots of different applications
//HTML DOM
//network routing
//abstract syntax trees
// AI
//Folders in operating systems
//JSON

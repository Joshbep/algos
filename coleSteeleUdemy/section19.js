//singly linked lists

//objectives
//define what a singly linked list is
//compare and contrast linked lists with arrays
//implement insertion, removal and traversal methods on singly linked lists


//what is a linked list?

//a data structure that contains a head, tail and length property.
//linked lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null
//singly linked lists only goes one way


//comparisons with arrays

//lists
//do not have indexes
//connected vio nodes with a next pointer
//random access is not allowed

//arrays
//indexed in order
//insertion and deltion can be expensive
//can quickly be accessed at a specific index

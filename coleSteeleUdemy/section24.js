//BINARY HEAPS

//heaps are another category of trees

//focusing on Binary heap

//objectives
//define what a binary heap is
//compare and contrast min and max heaps
//implement basic methods on heaps
//understand whee heaps are used in the real world

//what is a binary heap?
//very similar to a binary search tree, but with some diferent rules!
//in a maxBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes. In a MinBinaryHeap,
//parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes

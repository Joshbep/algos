//built in data structures for js and its BIG O
//wokring with Arrays, Objects and built in methods

//understand how objects and arrays work through the lens of BIG O
//compare and contrast runtimes

//When to use objects
//when you don't need order
//when you need fast access/insertion and removal

//Big O of Objects
//insertion - O(1)
//Removal - O(1)
//Searching - O(n)
//Access - O(1)
//when you don't need any ordering objects are an excellent choice


//methods with objects
//.keys - O(n)
//.values - O(n)
//.entries - O(n)
//hasOwnProperty - O(1)

//space quiz
//1
//O(1)
//2
//O(1)
//3
//O(1)

//when to use arrays?
//---when you need order
//when you need fast access/insertion and removal (sort of)

//access O(1)
//searching O(N)
//insertion it depends
//removal it depends

//push and pop always faster than shift and unshift

//built in data structures for js and its BIG O
//wokring with Arrays, Objects and built in methods

//understand how objects and arrays work through the lens of BIG O
//compare and contrast runtimes

//When to use objects
//when you don't need order
//when you need fast access/insertion and removal

//Big O of Objects
//insertion - O(1)
//Removal - O(1)
//Searching - O(n)
//Access - O(1)
//when you don't need any ordering objects are an excellent choice


//methods with objects
//.keys - O(n)
//.values - O(n)
//.entries - O(n)
//hasOwnProperty - O(1)

//when to use arrays?
//---when you need order
//when you need fast access/insertion and removal (sort of)

//access O(1)
//searching O(N)
//insertion it depends
//removal it depends

//push and pop always faster than shift and unshift

//Big O of Array operations
//push O(1)
//pop O(1)
//shift O(N)
//unshiftO(N)
//concat O(N)
//slice O(N)
//splice O(N)
//sort O(N * log n)

//algos and problems solvung patterns

//what is an algorithm?
//a process or a set of steps to accomplish a certain task

//HOW DO YOU IMPROVE
//1. Devise a plan for solving problems
//2. Master common problem solving patterns

//A simple, foolproof, magical, miraculous, fail-safe approach
//* NOT REALLY

//Problem SOLVING
//Understand the problem
//explore concrete examples
//break it down
//solve/simplify
//look back and refactor

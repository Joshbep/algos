//quick sort intro
//like merge sort, exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 element are always sorted
//works by selecting one element (called the "pivot")
//and finding the index where the pivot should end up in the sorted array


//Quick Start Function
//PIVOT HELPER

//Picking a pivot
//the runtime of quick sort depends in part on how one selects the pivot
//ideally, the pivot shoudl be chosen so that it's roughly the media value in the data set you're sorting
//for simplicity we'll always choose the pivot to be the first eleement


// pivot pseudocode
//it will help to accept three arguments: an array, a starting index, and an end index
//grab pivot
//store current pivot inde
//loop through the array

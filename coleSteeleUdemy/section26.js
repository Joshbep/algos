//GRAPHS

//objectives
//explain a graph
//compare and contrast different types of graphs and their use cases in rewal world
//implement a grpah using an adjacency list
//traverse through a graph using BFS and DFS
//compare and contrast grph traversal algos

//WHAT ARE GRAPHS
//a graph structure consists of a finite (and possible mutable) set of vehicles or nodes or points, together
//with a set of unorded pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph

//USES FOR GRAPHS
//social networks
//location / mapping
//routing algos
//visual hierarchy
//file system optimizations
//everywhere

//recommendations

//base definition

//it is a bunch of nodes iwht connections inbetween them

//TYPES OF GRAPHS
//essential graph terms
//vertex - a node
//edge - connection between nodes
//weighted/unweighted - values assigned to distances between vertices
//directed/undirected - directions assigned to distanced between vertices

//undirected graph
//no direction

//directed graph
//often represented with arrows
//has direction

//weighted graph
//each edge has value

//unweighted
//each edge has no value

//REPRESENTING A GRAPH

//adjacency matrix

//a matrix is a 2 dimensional structure typically implemented with nested arrays
//we store info in rows and columns

//ADJACENCY LIST

//WE WILL USE AN ADJACENCY LIST
//WHY?
//mainly the space it takes up
//most data in the real worl tends to lend itself to sparser and or larger graphs

//GRAPHS

//objectives
//explain a graph
//compare and contrast different types of graphs and their use cases in rewal world
//implement a grpah using an adjacency list
//traverse through a graph using BFS and DFS
//compare and contrast grph traversal algos

//WHAT ARE GRAPHS
//a graph structure consists of a finite (and possible mutable) set of vehicles or nodes or points, together
//with a set of unorded pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph

//USES FOR GRAPHS
//social networks
//location / mapping
//routing algos
//visual hierarchy
//file system optimizations
//everywhere

//recommendations

//base definition

//it is a bunch of nodes iwht connections inbetween them

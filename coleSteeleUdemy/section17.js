//radix sort intro

//comparison sorts
//average time complexity
//bubble sort O(n^2)
//insertion sort - O(n^2)
//selection sort (O(n^2))

//quick sort - O(n log n)
//merge sort - O(n log n)

//can we do better?
//yes, but not by making comparisons

//radix sort
//radix sort is a special sorting algo that works on lists of numbers
//it never makes comparisons between elements
//it exploits the fact that info about the size of a number is encoded in the number of digits
//more digits means a bigger number

//how does it work?

//BFS is shortest path doesn't mean fastest
//if you want to find the fastest you can use a different algorithm called Dijkstra’s algorithm.
//with Dijkstra’s algorithm each edge in a graph has a number associated with it which is a weight
//a graph with weights is called a weighted graph
//A graph without weights is called an unweighted graph.

// if it is unweighted to calculate the shortest path use breadth first search

//to calculate the shortest path in a weighted graph use Dijkstra’s algorithm

//an undirected graph means that both notes point to each other
//thats a cycle!

//Dijkstra’s algorithm only works with directed acyclic graphs, called DAGs for short.
